## My Arch dotfiles

## Introduction

This is some of the tools that I use daily on my workflow with Arch. (Currently Neovim, Zsh, and Zathura)

My configurations are not well-documented enough until now, they're also not totally finished, so this is a work-in-progress. I would also upload more things that I use on a daily basis and its config files. While you can copy my whole config files, it is not recommended though. You should have your own config file. You are encouraged to copy from this repo the part you feel useful and add it to your own configs. 

>NOTE: I'm not an english native speaker, so it will probably be some grammar mistakes here.If you are willing to help, you will be so grateful if you can make a pull request or an issue.

### Neovim

### Features
* It just werksâ„¢ for all platforms
* Modularized, with diferent source files for easy modification.
* Good basics in basics.vim, although I think they are a little bit bloated. It's a good start if you're a vim beginner.
* Amazing [icons](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons)
* Lean and mean [status bar/tabline](https:// github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
* Notetaking with [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki)
* CSS color [visualizer](https://github.com/chrisbra/Colorizer)
* Live server with [Bracey](https://github.com/turbio/bracey.vim)
* Easy comments with [Nerd Commenter](https://github.com/preservim/nerdcommenter)
* Web snippets with [Emmet](https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim) 
* [Apprentice](https://github.com/romainl/Apprentice), one of my favorite colorschemes.
* [Markdown Preview](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim=)
* Distraction-free writing with [goyo](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim)
* And more, see the source code.
>PD: I don't use an autocompletion engine for now. I don't really find one that I like. I will probably try [vim-lsp](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp) later though. 

### ZSH

### Features

Work in progress
